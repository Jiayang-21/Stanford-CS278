## Week 1

Social proof: when people copy each 
others’ behavior
In social situations when people are 
unable to determine the appropriate 
behavior, they look to what others are 
doing. 
The assumption is that others know 
what they are doing, so their behavior 
becomes a kind of proof

Channel factors: minor features upstream in a decision process that 
can produce large changes in behavior downstream [Ross and 
Nisbett 1991]. They are behavioral catalysts.
Students asked to get a tetanus shot were more likely to do it if they got 
a map to point out where the health center was, and a written list of its 
hours of operation. They already knew both of these facts. [Leventhal et 
al. 1965

Social Loafing
Many hands make…work…light?
When there are others contributing, we contribute less.
Experiment: blindfold a participant and get them to play team tugof-war. [Ingham 1974]
Except…there is actually nobody else on their team, they just think so. 
(Remember, they’re blindfolded.)
People pulled 18% harder when they thought they were the only one on 
their team than when they thought there were 2–5 others

Reciprocity
You are more willing to give back when someone does a favor for 
you. Even if you didn’t ask for the favor!
Experiment [Regan 1971]: in the context of another task, your 
partner goes out for a bathroom break.They either come back as 
normal, or bring a soda back for you. 
Participants in the unasked-for soda condition later bought more raffle 
tickets for their partners
