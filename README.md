## Week 1
 
### Social proof: 
when people copy each others’ behavior
In social situations when people are 
unable to determine the appropriate 
behavior, they look to what others are 
doing. 
The assumption is that others know 
what they are doing, so their behavior 
becomes a kind of proof

### Channel factors: 
minor features upstream in a decision process that 
can produce large changes in behavior downstream [Ross and 
Nisbett 1991]. They are behavioral catalysts.
Students asked to get a tetanus shot were more likely to do it if they got 
a map to point out where the health center was, and a written list of its 
hours of operation. They already knew both of these facts. [Leventhal et 
al. 1965

### Social Loafing:
Many hands make…work…light?
When there are others contributing, we contribute less.
Experiment: blindfold a participant and get them to play team tug war. [Ingham 1974]
Except…there is actually nobody else on their team, they just think so. 
(Remember, they’re blindfolded.)
People pulled 18% harder when they thought they were the only one on 
their team than when they thought there were 2–5 others

### Reciprocity:
You are more willing to give back when someone does a favor for 
you. Even if you didn’t ask for the favor!
Experiment [Regan 1971]: in the context of another task, your 
partner goes out for a bathroom break.They either come back as 
normal, or bring a soda back for you. 
Participants in the unasked-for soda condition later bought more raffle 
tickets for their partners


## Week 2

### Norms:
Describe common behavior, what one should or should not do. 
We intuit norms quickly. It has a HUGE impact on our behavior, even larger than the person himself.

### Stack Overflow's example:

The founders launched in a small private beta 
with 500 enthusiastic community members for 
three months before opening to everyone

What happened? By the time the site launched publicly, it was full 
of positive examples of technical questions 
answered helpfully and succinctly, which set the 
expectation.

For new users: 
Legitimate peripheral participation [Lave and 
Wenger 1991]: new members begin with low risk tasks while they absorb norms. On Stack 
Overflow, new users cannot up/downvote, edit 
questions and answers — only ask and answer

What happened: Users learn what kinds of questions and 
answers are valued before they can vote

There are downsides as well.

### Defaults influence norms:
Very few users change defaults: only 5% of Microsoft Word users in 
one study had ever changed any settings [Spool 2011]; only 19% 
changed the default public calendar setting [Palen 1999]
Why? Recall: Channel factors. (Amongst other reasons.)
Think about the defaults you encounter in social computing systems
Who do you share with by default on Facebook?
What’s the default sort order of posts?
What’s the default skin color of emoji?

### Anonymity:

create greater disinhibition, which results in 
more trolling, negative affect, antisocial behavior, and conformity to norms.

On the other hand, anonymity can foster stronger communal identity 
[Ren, Kraut, and Kiesler 2012] and more creativity [Jessup, Connolly, and 
Galegher 1990

Summary: anonymity and pseudonymity are 
playing with �. But, real name requirements 
can put victims of abuse and others at risk

### Unintended consequences:
Facebook’s design to connect people instead resulted in separation.
This reversal is not unique to Facebook — we’ll continue to cover it:
Twitter crowdsourced disinformation identification in 2021, but initially it 
was heavily used by political groups to flag their opponents’ tweets
SFUSD deployed an algorithm to more fairly assign students to schools, 
but it increased segregation: not all groups have access to information on 
how to navigate the algorithm [Robertson, Nguyen, and Salehi 2021]
Facebook opened up its API to great fanfare…but Cambridge Analytica.
Twitter empowers end user news via the Arab Spring…but fake news.
